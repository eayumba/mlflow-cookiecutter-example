# mlflow-cookiecutter-example

The template folder contains the cookiecutter.json and the mlflow-example project, but with some filenames and variables replaced with
{{cookiecutter.key_from_json}}. 

To use cookiecutter to create a project directory with template keys replaced with values of your choice, use the command
[ cookiecutter template ] while in this project folder.
